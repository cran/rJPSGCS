This is a collection of program written by Alun Thomas.
They are primarily for genetic linkage analyses of various sorts but
there are also programs for graph viewing, graph handling, and
random number generation.
<p>
Note that several of the programs are computationally demanding and
may take considerable time to run. If they throw an error indicating
that there was insufficient storage, increase this with the 
-Xms and -Xmx options to java.
